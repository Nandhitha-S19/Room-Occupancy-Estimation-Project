🔹 Without PCA

Without PCA means the model is trained using all original features directly, without reducing or transforming them into fewer components.

🔹 Using Threshold

Using threshold means converting predicted probabilities into class labels based on a chosen cutoff value instead of the default 0.5, to improve prediction performance.

🔹 (Optional) Without Threshold

Without threshold means class labels are predicted using the default probability cutoff (0.5) provided by the model.

| Model               | Without_Threshold | With_Threshold |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.93              | 0.95           |
| Decision Tree       | 0.94              | 0.96           |
| Random Forest       | 0.97              | 0.98           |
