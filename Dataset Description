Dataset Description

The dataset used in this study was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a widely recognized public repository for machine learning research. The dataset comprises environmental and sensor-based measurements collected from indoor spaces to estimate room occupancy status.

The recorded attributes include temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentration, light intensity, and other related environmental parameters. These features capture variations in indoor conditions that are indicative of human presence.

The target variable, Occupancy, is defined as a binary class label, where 1 represents an occupied room and 0 represents an unoccupied room. The dataset is suitable for binary classification tasks and is commonly used in research related to smart buildings, indoor environment monitoring, and occupancy detection systems.

This dataset enables the evaluation and comparison of machine learning models for occupancy estimation based on real-world sensor data.
